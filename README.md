### AvatarPresetManager
This piece of software allows you to create snapshots of your avatar state, and restore it at any moment. It uses VRChat OSC to function.

## TODO
- Implement blacklist fully
- Add UI
- Detect which avatar is loaded, and load into avatar if mismatch between OSC and config we are trying to apply
