### AvatarPresetManager
This piece of software allows you to create snapshots of your avatar state, and restore it at any moment. It uses VRChat OSC to function.

## Features
- Save an avatar state at any point
- Apply presets for current avatar
- Switch into a target avatar when the preset targets a different avatar (note: see known issues)
- Associate a name to an avatar ID
- Detects if VRChat is running in the background


## TODO
- Write how to use guide in info page and in repo
- Proper error handling
- FUCKIN UI CODE CLEANUP
- Logging ???
- Updater program
- Pink theme (JUST FOR SHY NOT FOR PUBLIC USE)

## Known issues
- Switching into an avatar only works if that avatar is favorited. [This is due to a VRChat bug](`https://feedback.vrchat.com/avatar-30/p/1626-osc-avatar-change-is-not-working`)
