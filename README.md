### AvatarPresetManager
This piece of software allows you to create snapshots of your avatar state, and restore it at any moment. It uses VRChat OSC to function.

## TODO
- Add rename feature (preset names, avatar id association)
- Implement settings object serialization/deserialization
- When a preset is created, if the avatar doesnt exist yet, prompt user for a name
- Updater program
- Localization system

## Known issues
- Switching into an avatar only works if that avatar is favorited. [This is due to a VRChat bug](`https://feedback.vrchat.com/avatar-30/p/1626-osc-avatar-change-is-not-working`)
